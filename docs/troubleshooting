0) If you think its a coding error:
   i) use ipdb - example 1 in python_examples

1) I don't know what function f(x) does/takes as input/returns (for functions that aren't defined in our code:
    i) in command line type 'python'
    you should get a prompt like:
    >>>
    you want to import any needed libraries and then type help(f)
    you will be put in a reader that is a help page. 
    Scroll or use arrow keys to move and press q to quit the reader
    for example if you function was numpy.array I would type python in the command line then:
    >>> import numpy
    >>> help(numpy.array)

    ii) google the function and find the document page - it will probably have less info than i)

    iii) ask the person who wrote it

2) Error like the following
   Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
   ImportError: No module named hadoop

   or NameError: name 'ipdb' is not defined

   i) make sure you are in your virtual environment if you are using one and "pip install x" where x is the missing package/module

   ii) if i) doesn't work then copy and paste all of your command prompt starting from the pip install into slack and someone who has dealt with weird pip things before

3) other:

  i) copy and paste error into slack
