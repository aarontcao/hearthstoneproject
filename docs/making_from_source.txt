For making python from 

For mac:
    get openssl (need homebrew package manager) (might already have it):
        brew install openssl

    download python source and extract it somewhere

    make a folder,SOMETHING, somewhere to install python to

    in your terminal, navigate into the Python3.5.6 folder inside the extracted folder

    set these variables to be the location for the openssl library (must be set in the terminal you install with since export only saves the variable temorarily for one session):
        export CPPFLAGS=-I$(brew --prefix openssl)/include
        export LDFLAGS=-L$(brew --prefix openssl)/lib
        export CFLAGS=-I$(brew --prefix openssl)/include
    note: to set a variable permanently, set it in ~/.bash_profile. also $(<SOMECOMMAND>) is replaced with the the output of <SOMECOMMAND> when it is evaluated. and brew --prefix PACKAGE gets the path to PACKAGE

    change the makefile configuration to install pip and set install location:
        ./configure --prefix=path/to/SOMETHING --with-ensurepip=install

    construct the makefile (the command is just "make" while you are in the right folder):
        make

    install using the makefile:
        make install

    note: makefiles are used to build C files and they often need to know where libraries it depends on are if they arent in the system library locations

    Python should work now and python can be run from the python3.5 executable that should be in SOMETHING/bin. Pip should also be in that folder. If it is not, it is a problem.

    If you want to make a virtual environment then:
       SOMETHING/bin/python3.5 -m venv location/to/store/venv/VENV-NAME
    To use it:
       source location/to/store/venv/VENV-NAME/bin/activate
    to turn it off:
       deactivate
